# govoz
This is reference repository for GoVoz application, which is written in Java in my free time. I will rewrite it using Flutter with better code structure and UI/UX.

The code started from old homemade binding library, GoFast - which is written by me also. Initially, all screens were written in Activity with one forum level is one Activity.

The code had been rewritten with just only main Activity for forum and sub-forums pages had been refactored from Activity to Fragment.
Many features are supported like Search, Expand/Collapse, GIF supports. I don't want add a lot of features since I want to keep the app compact and small, however I may change my mind.
